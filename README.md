# crystal_brain

An implementation of Brians Brain written in the Crystal programming language.

Among the first systems to simulate life-like behaviour, Cellular Automaton are abstract, discreet computational systems based on basic 'rules of life' that can display complex emergent behaviour.   These emergent behaviour have been used to model  behaviours and solve problems in physics, chemistry, cryptography and many other fields.

## Installation

* Clone repo
* Install crystal-lang and run from command line.

## Usage

The following command line options are supported:


    -v, --version                    Show version
    -h, --help                       Show help
    -i ITERS, --iterations ITERS     Iteration count
    -r SIZE, --rowsize SIZE          Board size on the x axis
    -c SIZE, --colsize SIZE          Board size on the y axis
    -t TIME, --time TIME             Animation sleep time
